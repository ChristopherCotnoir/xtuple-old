### What we're about

xTuple is ERP and CRM software -- automated, integrated business process
management and corporate relationship management.  Learn more at
[xTuple.com](http://www.xtuple.com).  The code is managed by an eponymous company
in Norfolk, VA, and our community stretches around the world. The xTuple client
is a [desktop app](https://github.com/xtuple/qt-client) written in the cross-platform
Qt framework.

Many of our customers are inventory-based manufacturers or distributors,
and we have a fair amount of code to specifically support
these use-cases. That said, businesses of all sorts, even services-based companies,
run their operations on our core.

### Why you might be interested in hacking on our software

The xTuple platform provides a great starting point for business software in
practically any industry. You get an entire stack to work on top
of, and a lot of business objects that you might want, like `Invoices`, `Currencies`,
`Tasks` and `Contacts` (and about a hundred more) are already implemented.

Moreover, one of the great strengths of the framework is extensibility and privilege
control. Our extension system allows for a high level of modularity, and keeps you
from having to rewrite the core. Fine-grained, centrally-managed privilege control
is also an important feature that businesses typically want, and we've taken special
care to implement it reliably across the application.

### What's Here?

[This repository](http://github.com/xtuple/xtuple) contains the source code for
the xTuple database and its node.js middleware. You can also find the code for our
[desktop client](https://github.com/xtuple/qt-client),
[OpenRPT report writer](https://github.com/xtuple/openrpt),
[CSVImport](https://github.com/xtuple/csvimp) utility, and a number of
extensions on [GitHub](https://github.com/xtuple).

### Installing this project

The best way to start coding on our stack is review our developer documentation in
the [qt-client](https://github.com/xtuple/qt-client/wiki) and
[xtuple](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple/wiki) wikis on GitHub.
